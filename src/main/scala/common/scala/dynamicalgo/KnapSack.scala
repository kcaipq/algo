  * Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in
  * the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights
  * associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum
  * value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item,
  * either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
